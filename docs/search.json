    "text": "1 On/Off Well Management\nThe Water Agreement and Green Book established protocols for determining the operational status of LADWP pumping wells, based on soil moisture and vegetation measurements. To fulfill monitoring requirements under the Agreement, the Water Department regularly assesses soil moisture content and vegetation leaf area index (in collaboration with LADWP) at 22 permanent sites within wellfields and seven sites in control areas. Soil moisture monitoring occurs monthly, while vegetation monitoring takes place annually in June. Each monitoring site is associated with one or more LADWP pumping wells.\nOn July 1st and October 1st, if soil moisture levels are inadequate to support vegetation needs at a site, the linked pumping wells go into off status. They remain offline until soil moisture levels surpass the threshold required by the vegetation at the time the linked wells went into off status. This operational approach is known as the On/Off management strategy.\nSince its inception in 1990, LADWP has frequently maintained numerous wells in the Off status, adhering to subsequent agreements with the County.\n\n2 Soil-Plant Water Balance and Groundwater\nData for each of the permanent monitoring sites (1990-present) is presented in four plots. The first plot includes pumped water from linked production wells. The second includes available water content (AWC) and vegetation water requirements (VWR) over time. The third plot includes the depth to water table (DTW) from the monitoring well on the site. The last plot represents time periods when the site was either in on or off status over the management period.\nThe right margin contains a photo of the site, production wells linked to the site, current on/off status, AWC required for well turn-on, and the identity of the associated monitoring well.\nInstructions\n\n\nZoom out: Double click on a plot to zoom out to the full time series extent.\n\nData point highlighting: Move cursor over the plot to display data values in the legend.\n\nPan: Use slider range selector to display custom time periods.\n\nZoom in: Drag horizontally to select time period or drag vertically to select a custom y-axis range.\n\nGrouped Selection: Selection in any plot will update all plots with this selection.\n\n\n2.0.1 LAWS MONITORING SITE #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws Monitoring Site #1\n\n\n\nLinked pumping wells- 247, 248, 249, 398.\nCurrent Status: ON\nSoil AWC req. for well turn-on: NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 795T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.2 LAWS MONITORING SITE #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws Monitoring Site #2\n\n\n\nLinked pumping wells - 236, 239, 243, 244\nCurrent Status: ON\nSoil AWC req. for well turn-on: NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: V001G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.3 LAWS MONITORING SITE #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws Monitoring Site #3\n\n\n\nLinked pumping wells - 240, 241, 399, 376, 377\nCurrent Status: ON\nSoil AWC req. for well turn-on: NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 840T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.4 BISHOP CONTROL SITE #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop Control Site #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: USGS 2AI\n\n2.0.5 BISHOP CONTROL SITE #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop Control Site #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 796T\n\n2.0.6 BISHOP CONTROL SITE #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishop Control Site #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 797T\n\n2.0.7 BIG PINE MONITORING SITE #1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Pine Monitoring Site #1\n\n\n\nLinked pumping wells - 210, 378, 379, 389\nCurrent Status: ON\nSoil AWC req. for well turn-on: NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 798T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.8 BIG PINE MONITORING SITE #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Pine Monitoring Site #2\n\n\n\nLinked pumping wells - 220, 229, 374, 375\nCurrent Status: OFF\nSoil AWC req. for well turn-on: 28.4, OFF 7-98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 799T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.9 BIG PINE MONITORING SITE #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Pine Monitoring Site #3\n\n\n\nLinked pumping wells - 222, 223, 231, 232\nCurrent Status: ON\nSoil AWC req. for well turn-on: NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 567T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0.10 BIG PINE MONITORING SITE #4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Pine Monitoring Site #4\n\n\n\nLinked pumping wells - 331\nCurrent Status: ON`\nSoil AWC req. for well turn-on: NA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth to Water: 800T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@report{2024,\n  author = {},\n  publisher = {Inyo County Water Department},\n  title = {Soil-Plant {Water} {Balance} and {Groundwater} - {Laws,}\n    {Bishop,} {Big} {Pine}},\n  date = {2024-05-24},\n  url = {https://github.com/inyo-gov/pumping-management},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\n“Soil-Plant Water Balance and Groundwater - Laws, Bishop, Big\nPine.” 2024.
